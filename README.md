# Exercism Python Track Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions to [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python) Python exercises.  
Each task here is a hands-on challenge aimed at deepening my Python skills — from algorithms and data structures to scripting and DevOps use-cases.

## My Approach

- 📝 **Multiple solutions:**  
  For most tasks, I try to implement more than one solution to practice different approaches and styles.
- 🚫 **No AI for first try:**  
  I always solve each problem first on my own, without any AI help.
- 🎯 **Study mode & optimization:**  
  After my own solution passes all tests and I am sure I can't optimize it any further on my own, I use ChatGPT Study Mode — exploring hints and best practices with ChatGPT acting as Senior python dev, without direct answers and code, to optimize and improve my code.

## Continuous Learning

- 🚀 **Daily practice:**  
  I solve new problems regularly to stay sharp and keep improving.
- 🃏 **Anki for retention:**  
  I create Anki cards for new and useful algorithms, patterns, and data structures I encounter, to reinforce long-term memory.

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to an Exercism Python exercise.  
Inside you'll find my solution code (sometimes several per exercise) and comments on approaches.
